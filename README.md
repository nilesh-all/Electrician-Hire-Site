# Milestone Project 1 - LSH Electricians

Click here for a link to the live project on GitHub [LSH_Electricians_MS1](https://leah1977.github.io/LSH_Electricians_MS1/).

This is a User-Centric Frontend Development Project for Milestone 1.

The project features four static pages where customers can see the services LSH Electricians provide.
The project targets potential and returning customers in need of electrical services.
I wanted to create a webpage that would allow the user to see what services we have a available and then to contact us with ease.

## Introduction

## Welcome!

This site was built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)/.

I have created a mobile-first user-centric frontend project.

I have created a website that focuses on the users needs.  Providing the user with relevant information.  So that the user can contact us for a quote or service as required.
I wanted to keep the website clearly laid out, so that the customer can easily navigate through the site.

Here is a demonstration of how my website looks on different screen sizes using [Am I Responsive Website](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/).

![Am I responsive](assets/images/responsivems1.png)

It is intended to be accessible on all screen sizes.  Although I am finding mobile devices are been used more often on a daily basis for searching for services.

## UX



I hope to attract a variety of users, from individual property owners to business property owners.  I hope that users will become clients and reuse the website on a regular basis to book call-outs and services.

## Project Goals


This website provides information on an electrical service for Domestic and Commercial clients.  LSH Electricians are an electrical company serving the Dublin area.  They serve both domestic and commercial clients.  We have been in business for 20 years and would like to launch a new website to promote our company. 

* To provide a website that is easy to navigate.

* To provide a website that is professional and has clear contact details.

* To provide the user positive feedback from other customers.

* To demonstrate to the user that we comply with saftey standards and are fully insured.

* To provide a clear range of services covering all your electrical needs, from small electrical household jobs to large commercial builds.  

* To provide a form to allow the user to request a quote or call-back.  


## User Stories

### As A First Time User:

* As a website user, I found myself constantly searching for a qualified electrician online but was unsure of what to ask for. I wanted to know did they meet all safety standards and was the work guaranteed.

* As a website user, I needed an electrician for an emergency call out. I wanted to find someone fast, efficient and reliable â€“ quickly. I also needed someone to call out at a time that was convenient to me.

What I expect to find on a website when looking for an electrician.

1. Do they have an emergency call-out option?
2. What times are they available?
3. Are they reliable?
4. What do other customers say about them?

* As a website user, I needed a qualified electrician to check our electrics and certify them for insurance purposes.
I expect to go onto a website and leave knowing that I will be looked after by a reliable electrician.

What I look for on a website when looking for an electrician.

1. Do they work with Safe Electric?
2. Are they registered and certified electricians?
3. Are they reliable?
4. Do they get good reviews?

### As a Regular User:

As a business owner, I want to be able to contact an electrician as needed.  I want to know that I can leave my details and that the company will be in touch to sort out the problem.

As a business owner, I want to be able to purchase items through the website.


With these user stories in mind, I put together some wireframes.  I included all the main requirements and issues that were raised from my user story research.

## Strategy


This website is for property owners, residential or commercial, looking to repair or update their electrics.
I want to provide a service that is easy to navigate, making it clear and quick to provide information and request a quote or call-out.
I will research what may be required for this website by asking the following questions.

* Would you use a website to look for an electrician?
* What would be your primary need for an electrician?
* Would you like a quote?
* What services would you look for?
* Would you like to see previous work completed in a gallery section?
* Would you like to read reviews from customers?

## Scope

Essentials will include

*	Callout - I want the customer to be able to contact our company through phone or email.

*	Emergency - I want the customer to be able to contact our company directly by the touch of a single button.

*	Insurance - I want the customer to know that we are fully qualified and insured electricians.

*	Guarantee - To ensure that the customer knows that we provide a high standard of work that we stand by.

*   A form to request callbacks and quotes - to provide a clear form that we reply to.

*   A gallery page to display work already carried out, showing our level of expertise and skills.

*   Contact details - clearly demonstrate where we are based and how to contact us.

## Skeleton


For layout I started with how I wanted my project to be structured.  I decided on using four separate pages all linked with one navbar.  I lay out my designs with some wireframes.

## Wireframes


I have used Balsamique to draw up wireframes for Mobile, iPad and desktop.

I have included wireframes for mobile, iPad and desktop. I plan to build my website from a mobile-first approach.  Using mobiles is becoming one of the more favoured ways to search for local services.

![Desktop Image](assets/images/wireframems1desktop.png)
![Mobile Image](assets/images/wireframems1mobile.png)


## Features

This project will include four separate pages.  I decided to separate the website into four separate pages.  The navbar and footer will be displayed on all pages for consistency.

* [index.html](#index.html)
* [services.html](#services.html)
* [contact.html](#contact.html)
* [gallery.html](#gallery.html)

## index.html

The home page is made up of a header.  The header includes a logo, the logo when clicked on will take the user to the home page. The company name and a navigational bar with four menu items also appear in the header.  The header will repeat on all pages.
On small screen sizes, the navigational bar will display as a burger icon, which will expand to a menu when clicked to accommodate the smaller screen size.

There is a Covid-19 notice to appear on the home page. 

The home page includes a large image.  The image is responsive to encourage the customer to focus on the overlay text box. The text box displays a call now button.  When you click on the call now button, a modal will appear.

The home page includes a section telling you about our company and the services we provide.

This page includes a Testimonial section so potential customers can read the reviews of our clients.

The footer has three sections. An about section telling you about the company.  An emergency call out section with a phone link.  The last section is to connect the customer to our social links.


## services.html

The services page has a section on the list of services we provide.

It will include a link to the contact page, where you can fill out a form for a quote or call-out.
 
* Emergency call-out
* Insurance and Testing
* Domestic Electrician
* Commercial Electrician
* Products
* Gallery with link to the Gallery page.



## contact.html

The contact page includes a map of Dublin provided by Google maps. This displays the area in which LSH Electricians work.

Contact and address information for the company.

There will also be a Form with a drop-down select menu, to enable the customer to direct their query.

## gallery.html

The gallery page displays a selection of photos and a video of work LSH Electricians provides.



## Surface Design:


## Colour Scheme


I will use the colours in the main body, header and footer.

![Color Scheme](assets/images/colorsms1.png)

My main primary colour will be yellow.  I will use variations of this colour to add warmth to the pages.  I have used this colour when I want something to stand out and catch the viewers attention.

I have chosen variations of white and grey to contrast against the yellow colour.  Further enhancing the features.

I used [Coolers](http://www.coolers.co) to generate my colours for the project. I then used variations within the project.

## Typography

I will use the following fonts throughout the website for consistency in style.

 * Roboto
 * Exo
 * Sans Serif as a back up

## Icons

I used [Font Awesome](https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css) for all my fonts and they can be seen accross the website, especially on the services page.

## Additional Features

* As our website progresses, I would like to include a search option and a spares/shop section.

* My form is static in this website and through further learning I would like to set it up so that the details can be saved and responded to.

* I would like the call now button to connect directly so that the customer has direct contact with our company.


## Project Display


This project is responsive to appear on different screen sizes.
The display changes to accommodate a smaller screen size.  On a mobile, some items have been removed to focus on the mobile-friendly application.  For example, the form reduces in size, so it can be displayed fully on a smaller device.

The navigational bar changes to a burger icon for smaller screen sizes. 
This opens out on click to display the menu items.

I will design the website to adjust to different sized screens to ensure optimum viewing.
I will make sure all links are active and working.

## Languages


* [HTML](http://wwww.html.com) Used for all four html pages as the main markup language for this project.
* [CSS](http://www.css-tricks.com) Used to style the content of my website.
* [JavaScript](http://www.javascript.com) Used through Bootstrap.

## Technologies

Code used throughout this project was learned and implemented from the [Code Institute Diploma Programme](https://codeinstitue.net)

In this project, I used the following to help build my website.

* [Font Awesome](https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css) for all the great icons.

* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?)

* [Bootstrap](https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css) throughout this project.

* [Balsamique](https://balsamiq.com/)
  
* [hover.css](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/hover.css/2.1.1/css/hover-min.css).

![Code used for the header was adapted from bootstrap 4.5.2](assets/images/header.png)

I used the code from bootstrap for my header.  Here I added a logo and company name.  
I also edited the css styling to suit my website and adjusted the layout to size appropriately.

![code used and adapted from Bootstrap for navbar](assets/images/header.png)

![code used and adapted from Bootstrap for modal](assets/images/bootstrapcodemodal.png)

I used the modal from bootstrap and edited the wording and styling for the call now button on the homepage.

##  Debugging


###     Debugging HTML in index.html


* Title displaying above Logo on all pages. Trying to position Title in the center of the Navbar or to the right of the logo.

* Added the bootstrap class "float-right" to the h1 element

* Navbar was displaying too close to the logo and title.  After a lot of trial and error and some much needed mentoring.  Fixed the bug by reversing the text-direction.  Styled as a media query.

```
@media screen and (min-width: 992px) {
   
   .navbar-expand-lg .navbar-collapse {
       flex-direction: row-reverse;
   }
}
```

This worked as I had intended.

* Burger icon was diplaying below logo on small screens.  This was not how I intended it to look, so I reduced the font size of the title on small screen sizes.



### Debugging HTML in services.html


* Items were displaying unevenly on larger screen sizes.

* Changed the bootstrap column class to display 3 items at a time instead of 4.

* White space was appearing below the footer when viewing on ipad pro.

![footer issue](assets/images/whitespacebug.png)

to fix this I added a media query to target the ipad pro size and added a min-width to the media query to allow the space to be filled.

Tested services .html W3C Markup Validation Service - no errors or warnings to show.

## Debugging on the contacts page

     
* Google map was not responsive on mobile devices.

* The google map was not displaying correctly when on smaller screen sizes.

* To solve this issue, I change the width to 100% so that it would appear the full width of the screen on all devices.

* The map would not pass through the html validator as a result of using a %.  Although it did work as intended on the the website.

![Map issue](assets/images/mapissue.png)

* To fix this bug I created an id for the map and inserted the width and height into the style.css.  I then add media queries as neccessary for the smaller screen sizes.


* Form was appearing too large on the desktop.

* Added a max-width to prevent the form from displaying full width on desktop.

* Form was displaying to the left on the iPad screen size.
* Adjusted the code by giving it a margin of 10px auto.  Also changed the max-width to 70% so it would not take up the whole width on an iPad screen size.

``` 
.center-form {
        
    min-height: 240px;
    margin: 10px auto;
    max-width: 70%;
  } 
  ```
## Debugging on the Gallery page


* Title of gallery section was displaying left of all images.

* Inserted a section container and gave it the title of the Gallery to display above the images.

![gallery-header](assets/images/gallerytitle.png)

## CSS debugging



* media query for menu items in the header was set too large for some devices.
* added an extra small media query for small screen sizes

```
@media screen and (max-width: 575px) {
   
 h1 {
     font-size: 20px;

 }

h2 {
    font-size: 1em;
    text-align: right;
    margin: 0;
    padding-right: 10px;
}
 
}
``` 

* Overlay not responsive. Missing half the writing when the screen size reduced.
* Added a media query in CSS to incorporate overlay to make it responsive.

![Mobile home page](assets/images/mobilehomepage.png)

* Large area of white space appearing below gallery on services.html page.
* Fix max-width on media query to remove white space.
